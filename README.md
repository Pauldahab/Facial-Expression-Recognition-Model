# Facial-Expression-Recognition-Model
# My custom facial expression recognition model uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework to accurately and efficiently detect if a person is awake or drowsy based on their facial expressions.

To train my model, i utilized custom datasets of images that captured a range of facial expressions indicating both awake and drowsy states. I carefully curated these datasets to ensure that they included a diverse range of facial expressions, lighting conditions, and backgrounds, in order to improve the robustness of my model.

The result is a highly accurate and reliable facial expression recognition model that can quickly and accurately detect whether a person is awake or drowsy based on their facial expressions.

Overall, this custom facial expression recognition model using YOLO represents a significant step forward in the field of driver safety, as it has the potential to be integrated into a wide range of applications such as driver monitoring systems in vehicles or even in industrial workplaces where fatigue may pose a risk.
